# Heimdallr 
 
Heimdallr is a large-scale chat application server inspired by the LINE+ chatting service architecture and written in Scala language based on Akka's actor model. It provides fault-tolerant and reliable scaling-out options, based on Redis Pubsub to support expansion from proof-of-concept to enterprise-ready solutions. It has been tested to be at least 100x faster than socket.io for large-scale systems. This project is licensed under the Apache License v2.0.

## Architecture

Heimdallrâ€™s architecture consists of a HTTP Server, a ChatRoomActor, and an UserActor. Each ChatRoom can be distributed across multiple servers. To synchronize the messages among servers, we uses Redis PubSub. UserActor is created per every websocket client.

## Comparison w/ Node.js and Socket.io 

The HTTP server test below was done using the [wrk benchmarking tool](https://github.com/wg/wrk) with 6 threads and 10000 connections on a single m4.large instance.

|  | Node.js | Heimdallr | 
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Requests per sec | 14533.90 | 20675.89 |
| Avg. Latency | 68.94 ms | 13.35 ms |
| Summary | 873389 requests in 1.00m, 108.36MB read<br>Socket errors: connect 8981, read 0, write 0, timeout 0<br>Requests/sec:  14533.90<br>Transfer/sec:      1.80MB | 1242244 requests in 1.00m, 181.26MB read<br>Socket errors: connect 8981, read 0, write 0, timeout 0<br>Requests/sec:  20675.89<br>Transfer/sec:      3.02MB |

This table shows the performance of event broadcasting, the average latency for a message to arrive at a websocket client. This test was done on the same m4.large instance as the HTTP server test.

|  | Socket.io<br>(single node) | Heimdallr<br>(single node) | Heimdallr Cluster<br>(2 nodes) | Heimdallr Cluster<br>(4 nodes) |

| 10 sub, 1 pub | 43 ms | 43 ms | 16 ms | 20 ms |
| 100 sub, 5 pub | 62 ms | 61 ms | 53 ms | 32 ms |
| 1000 sub, 10 pub | 496 ms | 390 ms | 129 ms | 47 ms |

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and try to build with sbt:

`% sbt run`

To setup a websocket load balancer, you can use HAProxy or Apache2 HTTPD with proxy modules. If you need to support heavy concurrency, AWS ALB or HAProxy is recommended. If you want to use Apache2, enable modules with the following command: `sudo a2enmod rewrite proxy proxy_http proxy_wstunnel proxy_balancer lbmethod_byrequests`

And edit the virtual host file like below:

```
<VirtualHost *:80>
        DocumentRoot /var/www/html

        ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
        CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined

        <IfModule proxy_module>
                RewriteEngine On
                RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/
                RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /$1 [P]

                ProxyRequests Off
                ProxyPass "/" balancer://mycluster/

                <Proxy "balancer://mycluster">
                        BalancerMember ws://{HEIMDALLR_SERVER_ADDRESS_1}:8080
                        BalancerMember ws://{HEIMDALLR_SERVER_ADDRESS_2}:8080
                </Proxy>
        </IfModule>
</VirtualHost>
```


To enable the Redis PubSub, open the application.conf file and edit the Redis IP address and port like below:

`redis-ip = "{REDIS_IP_ADDRESS}"` and `redis-port = 6379`

### Java Websocket Client Example

In this example, Java-WebSocket library was used.

```Java
public class WSClientSample extends WebSocketClient {

  public WSClientSample(URI serverURI) {
    super(serverURI);
  }
  ...
  
  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    String uri = ("ws://APACHE_WEBSERVERR/{CHATROOMID}");
    WSClientSample c = new WSClientSample(new URI(uri));
    c.connect();
  }
}
```

### Client Demo HTML example
